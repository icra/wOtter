Independent inputs are:
-

Dependent inputs are:
AGG_WWTP.df
basin_matrices.pkl
ordered_basins.pkl
river_graph.pkl
sorted_river_list.pkl
WWTP_per_basin.pkl
reference_raster.tif

Outputs are:
runtimes.csv

The dependent inputs are provided, but may be replicated.
All dependent inputs are created by installing the model. This may be done by running "runall.py"

The output is a dataframe that is used to create table 4 in the paper. Note that results will
be different depending on the computer that is used. Computers with less ram will have more
difficulty with some run methods, whereas computers with slower processors will have difficulty
with others.
