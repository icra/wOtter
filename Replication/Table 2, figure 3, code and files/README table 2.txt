Independent inputs are:
hydroWASTE rivers affected (see ref.)

Dependent inputs are:
river_graph.csv

Outputs are:
table 2.csv

The dependent inputs are provided, but may be replicated.
All dependent inputs are created by installing the model. This may be done by running "runall.py"

The output is a dataframe that is used to create table2 in the paper.

NOTE: Make sure that the directories in the R code point to the input files
