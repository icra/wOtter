The codes in the folders may be run independently to replicate any of the tables or figures in the paper
Klink. et. al. (2022).

To replicate the whole paper, follow the following order:

Step 1: Use runall.py to install the model from scratch.
Step 2: Run the python code in "Create observed occurences".
Step 3: Run the python code in "Calibration Table1, Table A1"
Step 4: Run the python code in "Calibration analysis, Figure 2".

Each step may be run independently since the files are already provided.
If you wish to follow the steps in order, copy the required files from previous steps into the folder
of the current step. The README's in the folders specify which inputs are required and where they are found.
